Customer personality analysis is crucial for businesses aiming to understand their customers better. By analyzing customer behavior, demographics, and spending habits, organizations can segment customers and create targeted marketing strategies. With the rise of data-driven decision-making, using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques allows for more efficient and accurate insights into customer behavior.
This project aims to leverage Parallel Computing and Deep Learning to perform customer personality analysis on a large dataset. The focus is on improving computation time while maintaining high prediction accuracy by applying state-of-the-art algorithms in a parallelized environment. Furthermore, Explainable AI (XAI) methods like LIME and SHAP will be used to interpret the modelâ€™s predictions, ensuring transparency and trust in the AI-driven decisions.
